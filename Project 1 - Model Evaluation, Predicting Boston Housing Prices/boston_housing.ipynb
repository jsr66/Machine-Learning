    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "Answer: I would expect a neighborhood with 'LSTAT' value of 15 to have home prices worth more than a neighborhood with an 'LSTAT' value of 20 since a lower percentage of poor working class workers indicates, according to my intuition, a more affluent set of homeowners and therefore higher home values. \n",

I'll assume that since the question says \"some ratio\" that the particular value of the ratio is not important to the explanation that the question is asking for. So I'll interpret the question as asking simply why a train/test split is beneficial. My answer to this question is that without such a split, one risks overfitting. Given sufficiently many parameters, one can always so to speak draw a curve through every data point and thereby capture the training data perfectly. The test data is there to determine how well the curve or model generalizes beyond the training data. Without a test set, one has no way of determining how well the model generalizes. On the other hand, without a training set, one has no data to fit the model to. A train/test split with a larger percentage of training data provides more data to train the model on, and thus offers the potential for the fitted model to reveal more detailed patterns in the data. On the other hand, one does not want to make the test set so small that one does not have enough data to determine how well the model generalizes.\n",

    "2) What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The score of the training curve decreases gradually from 1 to about 0.8, apparently converging to this latter value as the number of training points is increased; roughly, it reaches this asymptotic value at about 200 or 250 training points. The score of the testing curve increases from zero to about 0.8, again appearing to converge asymptotically to this latter value as the number of training points is increased; it reaches this value, or very close to it, at around 300 training points. \n",

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation.

    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "1) When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: It suffers from high bias. This is indicated by the fact that the training and validation scores are both close in value but low relative to the peak score at a depth of about 4; this suggests that the model is underfitting and has high bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: It suffers from high variance. The validation score reaches a peak at a maximum depth of about 4. Above this value, the validation score decreases while the training score continues to increase, indicating that overfitting occurs above this peak\n",

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "1) What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: One divides the total (ideally, shuffled) data set into a training set and a test set. One then further divides the training set into k equally sized subsets, training on k-1 of these subsets and holding out the last subset for testing/validation. One does this for each of the k possible splittings and averages the results over all k splittings. By this process, one achieves a cross validation score that can be used to tune the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: When doing grid search for a fixed train/test split, information about the test set can \"leak\" into the training process, since we are choosing the hyperparameters that maximize performance on the test set. We can avoid this problem by splitting the data set into three sets instead of two: i.e., into a training, validation, and test set, where hyperparameters in grid search are optimized on the basis of performance on the validation set instead of the test set. However, this procedure has the drawback that it can significantly reduce the amount of data that can be used to learn/train the model. Moreover, results of training and grid search can depend on the particular random split into training/validation/test sets. k-fold cross validation avoids dependence on the particular split by averaging over all splits, and also avoids the problem of having to spend data on an additional validation set by foregoing the use of a validation set.  \n",

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "1) How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Data from 1978 is still relevant insofar as inflation constitutes a gradual scaling up of home prices overall, but, apart from this re-scaling over overall prices, one expects that this does not necessarily affect the nature of the dependence of price on these predictive features. One would have to perform a more detailed analysis of how price dependence on the features investigated changes across different time windows with different levels of inflation relative to the initial time in 1978 at which the data starts. However, one must be careful in comparing prices using data from widely differening time periods as these involve different scalings for the price variable.\n",

    "2) Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps not. A more detailed answer is provided in the answer to question 3), which is closely related. \n",

    "3) Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it seems likely that these others factors would significantly affect the price of a house, since they strongly affect its desirability. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The range of roughly $70,000 represents an uncertainty of about 15-20 percent of the home prices. This is not very precise, but useful perhaps for some purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that data collected in an urban city would lose much of its predictivity in a rural city, since factors that affect the desirability of homes in a rural city (size of back yard) may be different in important respects from those that affect desirability of homes in an urban city (apartment view, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?\n",
