# Udacity Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects that I completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. Areas of machine learning covered include model evaluation and validation, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. This repository consists of five projects, one for each of these areas, with a separate folder for each project. All code is written in Python Jupyter notebooks, and primarily uses the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and keras packages.
