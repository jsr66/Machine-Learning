# Udacity Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains five machine learning projects that I completed as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. Areas of machine learning covered include model evaluation and validation, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning (feedforward and convolutional networks), and reinforcement learning (deep deterministic policy gradients). All code is written in Python Jupyter notebooks, and primarily uses the numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and keras packages.
